# Smart In-Campus Car Parking System

Problem Statement

To develop an intelligent application that provides a real-time parking slot within the campus when a car enters the main entrance. The car owners should have registered with the APP and must choose the building they work in. When the user enters the main entrance, the empty parking slot should be notified to the userâ€™s mobile and the nearest available parking slot should be assigned near to their chosen building where they work.
